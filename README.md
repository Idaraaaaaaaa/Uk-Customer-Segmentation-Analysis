# Uk-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

Project Overview:
This project involves cleaning and analyzing customer data from various regions in the UK. The goal is to perform segmentation analysis and visualize the results using Tableau.


Data Cleaning Steps:

1.Load Data:
Read the data from the "UK-Bank-Customers.csv" file using pandas.

2.Data Inspection:
Check for missing values and data types.
Summarize the dataset to understand its structure.

3.Data Cleaning:
Handle missing values.
Correct data types where necessary.
Remove duplicates.

4.Data Segmentation:
Segment customers based on:
Demographics (age, gender)
Geographic region


Visualization in Tableau Steps:

1.Export Cleaned Data:
Save the cleaned DataFrame to a CSV file.

2.Load Data into Tableau:
Import the cleaned dataset into Tableau.

3.Create Visualizations:
Demographic Segmentation: Bar charts, pie charts to show distribution by age, gender.
Geographic Segmentation: Map visualizations to show customer distribution across regions.

4.Dashboard Creation:
Combine visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard.
Use filters for interactive exploration of different segments.

Insights:
Customers in Scotland are predominantly males in their late 40s and early 50s, with a low representation of white-collar workers. In contrast, England has a higher representation of white-collar workers. Northern Ireland's customer base is mainly younger females, while data for Wales indicates an above-average representation of mid-sized account balances.

Conclusion:
This analysis provides insights into customer demographics, geographic distribution, and behaviors. The segmentation analysis helps in understanding different customer groups, enabling targeted marketing and improved customer service.
